I'm going to try and keep this as short and sweet as possible.
First off, I don't really care what you do with this, so feel free to use it anywhere and modify it however you please!

Really, the only part you need to read as someone who wants to use this casually is the example.lua file inside lua/ap_configs. It should explain how the configuration works and how to spawn panels.
I should note, I doubt permapropping these will work. If you want a panel to spawn when the map starts, put the PlacePanel function at the bottom of your configuration file like example.lua shows.

I doubt this thing is perfect, as I threw it together rather quickly so if you happen to find a bug or made an improvement you'd like to see pushed to main, let me know, it won't go without recognition! My main contact point is @apollomakesmusic on Discord.
(Also, feel free to contact me if you're having issues with it in general or just want some help setting it up)

Have fun y'all! Thanks for reading <3
